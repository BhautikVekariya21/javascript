// Function to initialize a user with a username
function local(username) {
    // Assign the username to the current instance
    this.username = username; 
    console.log(`${username}`); // Log the username
    console.log('name called');  // Indicate that the local function was called
}

// Function to create a user, calling the local function to set username
function createuser(username, email, password) {
    // Call the local function to initialize the username for the current instance
    local.call(this, username);
    
    // Assign email and password to the current instance
    this.email = email;
    this.password = password; 
}

// Create a new user instance using the createuser function
const soup = new createuser('soupx', 'soup@sopee.com', '12dnbdh321@#$');

// Log the created user object to see its properties
console.log(soup);

// Key Points:
// Constructor Functions:

// The local function acts as a constructor for initializing the username property of an instance.
// The createuser function serves as a higher-level constructor that initializes not only the username but also email and password.
// Use of call:

// The local.call(this, username) line allows local to access and modify the context of the instance created by createuser. This is crucial for correctly assigning the username to the createuser instance.
// Instance Creation:

// const soup = new createuser(...) creates a new user object with the specified properties.
// Output:
// When you run this code, you will see output similar to the following:

// css
// Copy code
// soupx
// name called
// createuser { username: 'soupx', email: 'soup@sopee.com', password: '12dnbdh321@#$' }
// This confirms that the username was successfully initialized, the local function was called, and the soup object was created with all the specified properties.

// Additional Suggestions:
// If you're planning to expand this functionality or maintain it, consider:

// Using ES6 Classes: Classes can provide a cleaner syntax and better structure for your code.
// Data Validation: Consider adding validation to check for valid email formats and password strength.
// Using this Properly: Ensure that this refers to the correct context in more complex code or when using arrow functions.
