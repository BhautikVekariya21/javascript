<!-- Number Guessing Game
This project is a simple number guessing game where users try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

HTML Structure:

The HTML file consists of a title, instructions, and a form where the user can input their guess.
The form includes:
An input field for entering the guessed number.
A submit button to submit the guess.
There are sections to display previous guesses, the number of guesses remaining, and feedback on whether the guess was too high or too low.
Key Elements:

Header and Instructions: Inform users about the game and how to play.
Input Form: Allows users to input their guess and submit it.
Result Display: Shows previous guesses and how many attempts remain.
Styling:

The game is styled using an external CSS file (guess.css) linked in the head section of the HTML.
Usage:

Open the HTML file in a web browser.
Enter a number between 1 and 100 in the input field and click "Submit Guess."
The game will keep track of your previous guesses and the number of attempts left.
This project demonstrates basic HTML structure and form handling, making it a good exercise for beginners in web development.
